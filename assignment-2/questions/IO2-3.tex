\section*{IO.II-3}

According to section $6.2$ in the course-notes, any sorting algorithm is as hard as a permutation problem. Moreover, the I/Os lower bound for permutation problems is also the lower bound for any sorting algorithm. According to theorem $6.2$, the lower bound of a permutation problem is $\Omega(SORT(n))$, and this bound is proven to be tight.\\

We know that $SORT(n) > n/B$. Therefore, there are no sorting algorithms that can perform $O(n/B)$ I/O's, regardless of its runtime complexity.
