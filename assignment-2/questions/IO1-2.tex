\subsection*{(i)}
Let $T(n)$ denote IO's of the problem and $T_x$, $T_y$ and $T_z$ denote IO's of matrix $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ respectively.
For each cell in $Z$, we need
\begin{align*}
	T_x &\leq \frac{\sqrt{n}+2(B-1)}{B}\\
	T_y &\leq \sqrt{n} \\
	T_z &= 1
\end{align*}
Then, the total IO's we need for computing a cell is :
$$\frac{\sqrt{n}+2(B-1)}{B} + \sqrt{n} + 1$$
Therefore, the total IO's that we need to compute the product $Z=XY$ :
\begin{align*}
	T(n) &\leq ( \frac{\sqrt{n}+2(B-1)}{B} + \sqrt{n} + 1	)n\\
	&\leq \frac{n\sqrt{n}+2n(B-1)}{B} + n\sqrt{n} + n \\
	&= O(n\sqrt{n})
\end{align*}

\subsection*{(ii)}
If $Y$ is stored in $column-major$ order. For each cell, we will use $$T_y=\frac{\sqrt{n}+2(B-1)}{B}$$.
Therefore, the total IO's is
\begin{align*}
	T(n) &\leq ( 2\frac{\sqrt{n}+2(B-1)}{B} + 1	)n\\
	&\leq \frac{2n\sqrt{n}+4n(B-1)}{B} + n \\
	&= O(\frac{n\sqrt{n}}{B})
\end{align*}

\subsection*{(iii)}

% Image of X and Y how to find memory needed.

In order to compute sub-problem, all variables that we have in sub-problem should fit into main memory. 

Let $M_x$, $M_y$ and $M_z$ denote memory space that is required by $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ when computing a sub-problem

For each sub problem, we need
\begin{align*}
	M_x &= t(2t + 2(B-1)) \\
	M_y &= 2t(t+2(B-1))\\
	M_z &= t(t+2(B-1))
\end{align*}
Let $M$ denote the total memory we have. Then, we find IO's recursive base case which happens when all variables in sub-problem can fit into main memory.
\begin{align*}
M_x + M_y + M_z &\leq M \\
5n^2 + 6(B-1)n &\leq M
\end{align*}
Thus, we can formulate recurrence IO's complexity function of this algorithm.
\begin{align*}
	T(t) = \begin{cases}
	    \frac{5t^2 + 6(B-1)t}{B},& \text{if } 5t^2 + 6(B-1)t \leq M\\
	    4T(\frac{t}{2}),              & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{align*}
\\
\\
\textbf{Theorem.} the IO's complexity of the algorithm is $O(t^2/B)$
\begin{proof}
We will proof this theorem by induction.\\

Assume, $t'$ is the value that satisfies base case condition, 
\begin{align*}
	5t'^{2} + 6(B-1)t' \leq M
\end{align*}

Hence, for some $t'$ the I/O's complexity is :
\begin{align*}
	T(t') \leq O(t'^2/B)
\end{align*}

Then, we can derive the I/O's complexity of the next case:
\begin{align*}
	T(2t') &\leq 4T(t') \\
	&\leq 4 O(t'^2/B) \\
	&\leq O( 4t'^2/B ) \\
	&\leq O( (2t')^2/B ) \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the IO's complexity of the algorithm is $O(t^2/B)$ as claimed.
\end{proof}


\subsection*{(iv)}

Claim : The algorithm from (iii) has better spatial locality.

To prove the claim, as we can see from (i), the algorithm does not use blocks of $Y$ effectively. When it fetches a block of $Y$, it uses only one variable and move on. In contrast, the algorithm from (iii) can use all variables in a block. Because the variables are kept in main memory and used during the execution of sub problem.
\\\\
Claim : The algorithm from (iii) has better temporal locality. 

To prove the claim, assume $B_0$ is the first block of $Y$. In (i), the algorithm will need the block again when the algorithm finishes $m$ iterations while the algorithm from (iii) will need the block after $m/2$ iterations which is 2 time shorter than (i).
