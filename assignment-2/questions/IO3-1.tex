\section*{IO.III-1}

\subsection*{(i)}
When the subarray fits into 1 block, then one of the subtree does not need any more I/Os and the other one needs one more I/O (because the next center is in a consecutive block).\\ 

The number of steps needed to reach such case is $\log(n/B)$. Then the error of the number of I/Os is $O(1)$. We have:
$$\#I/Os = \log(n/B) \pm O(1)$$

\subsection*{(ii)}
Instead of storing blocks as in-order traversal, we will separate the tree in to small subtrees of size B and store it into a block as shown in figure \ref{fig:blocking}.\\
\\We know that the depth of the tree is $\log n$ and the depth of subtree is $\log B$. Therefore IO's complexity of root-to-leaf traversal is :
$$T(n) = \frac{\log n}{\log B} = \log_{B} n$$

As shown in figure \ref{fig:blocking}, this blocking strategy make the tree look similar to B-tree in a sense that
its nodes are grouped into subtrees and each subtree is comparable to a node in B-tree that can have more than 1 element.
