\textbf{Theorem.} The algorithm performs $O( SORT(|V|+|E|) )$ and returns valid solution.

\begin{proof}
We observe that each iteration the algorithm performs $$2O( SORT(1 + |N_{in}(v_i)| ))$$
One from $Extract-Min$ operation and the other from $Insertions$. \\
Thus, the total I/O's complexity  is :
\begin{align*}
 \sum^{n-1}_{i=0}{O( 1 + |N_{in}(v_i)} = O( SORT( |V|+|E| ))
\end{align*}
\\
To prove that the algorithm returns valid solution. We first argue that the algorithm does not use more than $d_max + 1 $ colours . Secondly, there are not 2 adjacent nodes having same colour because each time it picks a colour the list of colours is subtracted by colours used for its in-neighbors.
	
\end{proof}
