\textbf{Theorem.} The algorithm performs $O( SORT(|V|+|E|) )$ and returns valid solution.

\begin{proof}
    Let denote $N_{in}$ a set of in-neighbor of $v_i \in V$. We observe that each iteration the algorithm performs
    $$2O( SORT(1 + |N_{in}(v_i)| ))$$
One from $Extract-Min$ operation and the other from $Insertions$. \\
Thus, the total I/O's complexity  is :
\begin{align*}
    T_{io}(G(V,E)) &= \sum^{n-1}_{i=0}{O( 1 + |N_{in}(v_i)|)} \\
    &= O( SORT( |V|+|E| ))
\end{align*}

To prove that the algorithm returns valid solution. We first claim that the algorithm does not use more than $d_{max} + 1 $ colours because
there is always at least 1 colour left in the list $C$. Secondly, there are no 2 adjacent nodes having same colour
because every time the algorithm chooses a colour, it chooses a colour from the list which is subtracted by the set of colours used by its in-neighbors.

\end{proof}
