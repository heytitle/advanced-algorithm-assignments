\subsection*{(i)}

The best possible scenario in the presented case is similar to following:

$$ (x_1 \vee x_2  \vee x_3) \wedge (x_1 \vee x_4 \vee x_5) \wedge (x_1 \vee x_6 \vee x_7) $$

It can be seen that in this case $ x_1 $ is present in all the clauses of the DNF therefore we can eliminate all the clauses of the equation in the first run. This gives us a following lower bound:
$$ LB = 1 $$ 

We deduce then:

$$ OPT \ge 1 $$

We define approximation ratio $ \rho $ as:

$$ \rho = \frac{ALG}{OPT} $$

Since we don't know if duplication of elements in a clause is allowed or not we will examine two possible scenarios.\\

\textbf{Duplication allowed:}\\

Consider the case when:\\

$$ (x_1 \vee x_2  \vee x_2) \wedge (x_1 \vee x_3 \vee x_3) \wedge (x_1 \vee x_4 \vee x_4) ... \wedge (x_1 \vee x_n \vee x_n) $$

We choose in each iteration elements unique for the clause like $ x_2 , x_3 , x_4 ... x_n $. So we end up having chosen $ n $ elements, excluding the one that was common in all the clauses. That gives us:

$$ ALG = (n-1) $$ 
$$ \rho = (n-1) $$ \\

\textbf{Duplication disallowed:}\\

If duplication is not allowed as in the following DNF:

$$ (x_1 \vee x_2  \vee x_3) \wedge (x_1 \vee x_2 \vee x_4) \wedge (x_1 \vee x_2 \vee x_5) ... \wedge (x_1 \vee x_2 \vee x_n) $$

We can see that the algorithm chooses $ n-2 $ resulting in :

$$ ALG = (n-2) $$ 
$$ \rho = (n-2)  $$

\subsection*{(ii)}
For the algorithm to become a 3-approximation algorithm it should be modified so that in each iteration it chooses all three elements in a clause and eliminate all the clauses in DNF that contain any of these three elements.\\

\textbf{Proof}

Let $ D^* $ be a subset of $ D $ that only contains clauses that don't share any variables.

The optimal solution to the problem $ OPT $ contains at least one variable from each clause therefore :
$$ OPT \ge |D^*| = LB $$ 

In our algorithm after the modification, we select three variables in each clause in $ D^* $,
because there are no clauses that share common variables with them.
The other clauses which have common variables as any clause in $ D^* $ are deleted.
Thus:
$$ ALG \le 3 |D^*| = 3 * LB $$

So it is a 3-approx algorithm.
