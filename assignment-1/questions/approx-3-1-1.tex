Let $ T = \sum_{j=1}^{n} t_i $ be the total time of all the jobs.
Since we define large job as having time  $ t \ge \epsilon T $, the maximum number of large jobs is:
$$ n_{max} = \frac{T}{\epsilon T} = \frac{1}{\epsilon} $$

For each large job, there are two possible ways of assigning it to a machine.
Therefore the possible ways that $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ jobs can be scheduled into 2 machine is:

$$ Number Of Ways = 2^{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} $$

Since machine 1 and machine 2 are identical (e.g. $0-n$ and $n-0$ are equal), we remove the duplicates leaving the 
total number of schedules at :

\begin{align*}
	Number Of Ways &= \frac{2^\frac{1}{\epsilon}}{2} \\
	&= 2^{\frac{1}{\epsilon}-1}
\end{align*}
