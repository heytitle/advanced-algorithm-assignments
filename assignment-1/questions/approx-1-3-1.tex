Assume we have the optimal solution, which has $n$ squares
\begin{align*}
    n \le LB \le OPT
\end{align*}

\begin{lem}
    Each unit square in the grid can overlap at most 4 cells.
Let $n_s$ be the number of square in the integer grid solution. Thus
    \begin{align*}
        n_s \le 4n \le 4OPT
    \end{align*}
\end{lem}
