Assume we have the optimal solution, which has $n$ squares. That is:
\begin{align*}
    n \le LB \le OPT
\end{align*}

Now we put our set of points into a grid with unit-size cells. Each unit square can overlap at most 4 cells in such a grid, then our optimal solution can be split into at most $4n$ squares. Therefore,
\begin{align*}
  ALG \leq 4n = 4.OPT
\end{align*}

So this algorithm is 4-approximation.
